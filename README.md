    <h1>Defensive Security Project</h1>
    <p>by: Adrian Davy</p>
    <p>This week, you will work in groups to use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. On Day 1, you'll use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional organization. On Day 2, you'll determine whether that monitoring solution will protect the organization from several simulated attacks. On Day 3, you'll showcase your defensive project with a group presentation to the class.</p>
    <h2>Create a Monitoring Solution to Protect VSI</h2>
    <p>Specifically, you will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Load and analyze Windows logs.</li>
      <li>Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows logs.</li>
      <li>Load and analyze Apache logs.</li>
      <li>Create reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Apache logs.</li>
      <li>Install an add-on Splunk application for additional monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Today, you will play the role of an SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI), which designs virtual-reality programs for businesses.</li>
      <li>VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may launch cyberattacks to disrupt VSIâ€™s business.</li>
      <li>As an SOC analyst, you are tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on your systems and applications.</li>
      <li>The VSI products that you have been tasked with monitoring include:
